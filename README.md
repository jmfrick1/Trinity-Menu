# Trinity ASTS - Advanced Sensory and Targeting System

## Overview

Trinity ASTS is a modular and discreet enhancement system designed for FPS games. It provides advanced sensory and targeting capabilities, enhancing the player's situational awareness and aiming precision without compromising security and detectability. The project is currently under development, focusing on integration with the game and USB injection mechanisms.

## Features

### Advanced Visualization System (AVS):

- **Player Awareness:** Gain insights into player positions and movements.
- **Resource Highlighter:** Identify valuable items and resources in the game environment.

### Enhanced Targeting Module (ETM):

- **Precision Assistance:** Fine-tuned targeting with adjustable settings for various scenarios.
- **Adaptive Targeting Support:** Customize the level of targeting assistance to fit different gameplay situations.

### Stealth Security Suite (SSS):

- **Comprehensive Security Protocols:** Ensure the system remains undetectable.
- **Sophisticated Obfuscation Methods:** Employ advanced techniques to protect the system from detection.

## Current Status

### Incomplete Integration:
- The software currently does not fully function as intended and requires significant testing and further development.
- Missing key components such as memory codes and game injection mechanisms.
- Needs robust methods to test against active anti-cheat systems discreetly.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository:
\`\`\`
git clone https://github.com/jmfrick1/Trinity-Menu.git
cd Trinity-Menu/ASTS
\`\`\`

### Set Up Virtual Environments:
- Create virtual environments for the server and application:
\`\`\`
python -m venv venv_server
python -m venv venv_flask
\`\`\`

### Install Dependencies:
- Activate the virtual environments and install required packages:
\`\`\`
source venv_server/bin/activate
pip install -r server-requirements.txt
deactivate

source venv_flask/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
deactivate
\`\`\`

### Generate Fernet Key:
- Generate and store the Fernet key for secure data handling:
\`\`\`
source venv_flask/bin/activate
python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())" > config/fernet.key
deactivate
\`\`\`

## Usage

### Start the Server:
\`\`\`
source venv_server/bin/activate
python server.py
\`\`\`

### Run the Application:
\`\`\`
source venv_flask/bin/activate
python app.py
\`\`\`

### Access the Interface:
- Open your web browser and navigate to the specified local address to access the ASTS control panel.

## Security and Maintenance
- Regularly update the repository to ensure you have the latest security patches.
- Follow best practices for code obfuscation and encryption to maintain undetectability.
- Explore secure testing methods to ensure the software's integrity and functionality without detection by anti-cheat systems.
